This is the open-source C++ API library for Yahoo! Fire Eagle
(http://fireeagle.yahoo.net)

Right now, this is pretty much a work in progress. If you think you can manage
with that, you are most welcome to use it,as per the copyrights mentioned in
the headers. Do let me know if you find this useful.

To compile and link, you would need:
1. liboauth from http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/
2. expat (and expat-devel) http://expat.sourceforge.net/
3. curl (and curl-devel) http://curl.haxx.se/

Please report bugs to arnob.nandi@gmail.com

The details below should mostly work on all *nix systems. I have only tested
on Fedora Core 9 and RHEL 4 using curl-devel 7.18.1, expat-devel 2.0.1 and
liboauth 0.4.5. (On a side note, libfireeagle does not have a version as of
now... see TODOs)

Do not ask me about Windows or other systems right now. If you can get it to
work on one, please let me know the changes, I will be happy to merge it in
(with proper acknowledgements and disclaimers of course :) )

BUILD:
Assuming that the above dependencies are installed in the standard places where
the default compilation process can find the headers and the libraries. The
toplevel Makefile provided should build fine with most GNU toolchains, so just
run a 'make' from the command line. Provision for 'make clean' exists.

After the make, the libfireeagle.so should be in the src/ directory.

DOC:
After the build, assuming that you have doxygen installed, the class
documentation should be available in doc/html

TEST:
There is a Makeile in the test directory. This builds test/deskapp. Please
run test/deskapp --help to see different options.

INSTALL:
This is a manual process as of now. Copy the files in include to where your
standard 3rd party headers reside. Copy libfireeagle.so to where your
liboauth.so is.

Have fun.
