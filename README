This is the open-source C++ API library for Yahoo! Fire Eagle
(http://fireeagle.yahoo.net)

Right now, this is pretty much a work in progress, so only the sources are
visible. If you think you can manage with that, you are most welcome to use it,
as per the copyrights mentioned in the headers. Do let me know if you find this
useful.

To compile and link, you would need:
1. liboauth from http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/
2. expat (and expat-devel) http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Do report bugs to arnob.nandi@gmail.com
